Postman can be downloaded here - https://www.getpostman.com/
You can simply import "Clima.postman_collection.json" to get the request.

I did not include the environment setup as it includes my unique addID, please read the API docs to learn how to create your own appID.
If you need help setting up the environment please ask, or simply strip out my variables and create your own, or just dump the whole URL to get started :) 

OpenWeather API (and the API docs) - http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather 

It's a good idea to have a decent ext editor installed, I use Atom - https://atom.io/
I recommend you install this package to prettify any JSON objects - https://atom.io/packages/pretty-json 
This can be done from the preferences within Atom (it's really easy - but I'm happy to help just ping me or ask Google :P) 

Lastly this guy seems to know a whole lot about WireMock, please check it out - https://handstandsam.com/category/wiremock/
I know It has Android in the name but it's worth a look, and the video recourses helped me a lot.

Lastly I would like to point you guys towards the WireMock docs - http://wiremock.org/docs/record-playback/
A very good place to start :) (weird that I mention it last right?)
